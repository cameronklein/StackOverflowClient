I just can't seem to find any, I'm wondering why all the wrappers out there seem at some point to want you to write a textual SQL statement such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT * FROM stock WHERE item = 'Hotdog Buns'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>here's MySQL++ for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mysqlpp::Query query = conn.query(\"select * from stock where item = 'Hotdog Buns'\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The most obvious way to do this for me is to create a class that contains properties (columns) with each instance of that class being a row.  So to do the above query I would do something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Class defined something like this...\nclass stock_item : public sql::row\n{\npublic:\n\n   stock_item() : m_name( NULL ), m_amount( 0 ) {};\n   ~stock_item() {};\n\n   // Statically define the table\n   static void CreateTable( void )\n   {\n      // Some C++ reflective mechanism\n      sql::column( \"name\",   char[50] );\n      sql::column( \"amount\", u32 );\n   }\n\nprivate:\n\n   const char* m_name;\n   u32         m_amount;\n}\n\n// Then a table defined like this\nsql::table&lt;stock_item&gt; stock;\n\n// Query function defined something like this...\nstock GetHotDogBuns( const stock&amp; shopStock )\n{\n   stock hotDogBuns = shopStock.Select( stock_item::Name(), \"Hotdog Buns\" );\n   return hotDogBuns;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I'm no SQL expert and I haven't spent very long thinking about the above code but it just seems quite a logical way to deal with a database if your from a C++ background rather than having to be a database expert.  What are the problems with this kind of approach?</p>\n\n<p>Is there an open source library that allows you access to a database in a similar fashion?</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT</em> The reason why I would like something like this is so that C++ programmers using our code don't have to learn SQL syntax and to provide a much more natural environment for them to code in.  I've seen something like this in the SilverStripe CMS written in php.</p>\n"},{"tags":["programming-paradigms"],"owner":{"reputation":5384,"user_id":159072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a85571ffa02cee3b1f8f8197788de5c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BROY","link":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/159072/broy"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":1278,"accepted_answer_id":8183514,"answer_count":4,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1415529368,"creation_date":1317271111,"last_edit_date":1321361662,"question_id":7592505,"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7592505/can-you-represent-the-same-example-using-procedural-functional-logic-and-oo-pr","title":"Can you represent the same example using Procedural, Functional, Logic and OO programming Languages?","body":"<p>Can anyone please provide me with an example that can help me to understand Procedural, functional, Logic and Object Oriented programming models side by side by using nearly same example-problem.</p>\n\n<p>Please give me example code-snippets of the somewhat same problem using Procedural, Functional, Logic and OO programming languages.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","winapi","visual-studio-2013"],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":3369055,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95907c6e0f7272808769d7cf7ba811b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Josh Lcs","link":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/3369055/josh-lcs"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"accepted_answer_id":26816359,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1415445754,"creation_date":1415444074,"last_edit_date":1415445754,"question_id":26816320,"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26816320/creating-a-window-in-oo","title":"Creating a window in OO","body":"<p>Here is my header</p>\n\n<pre><code>#pragma once\n#ifndef BASE_H\n#define BASE_H\n\n#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;\n#include &lt;windowsx.h&gt;\n\nclass Base\n{\n    HWND hWnd;\n    WNDCLASSEX WndCls;\n    HRESULT Hr;\npublic:\n    Base();\n    static LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);\n    void RegisterWnd(HINSTANCE hInstance);\n    void ShowWnd(int nCmdShow);\n    ~Base();\n};\n\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my base.cpp</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"Base.h\"\n\n\nBase::Base()\n{\n}\n\nstatic LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)\n{\n    // sort through and find what code to run for the message given\n    switch (message)\n    {\n        // this message is read when the window is closed\n    case WM_DESTROY:\n    {\n        // close the application entirely\n        PostQuitMessage(0);\n        return 0;\n    } break;\n    }\n\n    // Handle any messages the switch statement didn't\n    return DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam);\n}\n\nvoid Base::RegisterWnd(HINSTANCE hInstance)\n{\n    ZeroMemory(&amp;WndCls, sizeof(WNDCLASSEX));\n    WndCls.cbSize = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX);\n    WndCls.hbrBackground = (HBRUSH)COLOR_WINDOW;\n    WndCls.hCursor = LoadCursor(NULL, IDC_ARROW);\n    WndCls.hIcon = LoadIcon(hInstance, NULL);\n    WndCls.hIconSm = LoadIcon(hInstance, NULL);\n    WndCls.hInstance = hInstance;\n    WndCls.lpfnWndProc = WndProc;\n    WndCls.lpszClassName = \"ClsName\";\n    WndCls.style = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW;\n\n    Hr = RegisterClassEx(&amp;WndCls);\n    if (FAILED(Hr))\n        MessageBox(NULL, \"Window Class failed to register.\", \"ERROR\", MB_OK);\n\n    hWnd = CreateWindowEx(\n        NULL,\n        \"WndClassName\",\n        \"WndName\",\n        WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,\n        100, 100,\n        480, 640,\n        NULL,\n        NULL,\n        hInstance,\n        NULL);\n    if (FAILED(hWnd))\n        MessageBox(NULL, \"Window Class failed to create\", \"ERROR\", MB_OK);\n}\n\nvoid Base::ShowWnd(int nCmdShow)\n{\n    Hr = ShowWindow(hWnd, nCmdShow);\n    if (FAILED(Hr))\n        MessageBox(NULL, \"Failed to display Window\", \"ERROR\", MB_OK);\n}\n\nBase::~Base()\n{\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is my main.cpp</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"Base.h\"\nLRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);\nint WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPTSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)\n{\n    Base CreateWnd;\n\n    CreateWnd.RegisterWnd(hInstance);\n    CreateWnd.ShowWnd(nCmdShow);\n\n    MSG Msg;\n    while (GetMessage(&amp;Msg, NULL, 0, 0))\n    {\n        // translate keystroke messages into the right format\n        TranslateMessage(&amp;Msg);\n\n        // send the message to the WindowProc function\n        DispatchMessage(&amp;Msg);\n    }\n\n    // return this part of the WM_QUIT message to Windows\n    return Msg.wParam;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is, I keep getting this error message that I dont understand of.

For example, we can encode the elements of SML module system in Scala as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SML signatures: Scala traits with no concrete members</li>\n<li>SML structures with given signatures: Scala objects extending given traits</li>\n<li>SML functors parameterised by given signatures: Scala classes taking objects extending given traits as constructor arguments</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Are there any significant features such an encoding would miss? Anything that can be expressed in SML modules that encoding can't express? Any guarantees that SML makes that this encoding would not be able to make?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","oop","design-patterns","maintainability","object-oriented-analysis"],"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":2560218,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0FOFG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kaizar Laxmidhar","link":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/2560218/kaizar-laxmidhar"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":107,"accepted_answer_id":22988467,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1410426070,"creation_date":1397050853,"last_edit_date":1397051130,"question_id":22964415,"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22964415/java-currency-converter-adhering-to-oo-object-oriented-principles","title":"Java Currency Converter adhering to OO (Object Oriented) principles","body":"<p>A command line currency converter application that prompts for a user input of\nsource currency, source currency code and target currency code e.g. </p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\workspace&gt; java CurrencyConverter 100.50 EUR GBP\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The application returns the value of the source amount converted to the target currency\ne.g. for the above input it returns</p>\n\n<pre><code>100.50 EUR = 86.33 GBP\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After displaying the converted value the program exits.</p>\n\n<p>The available exchange rates (GBP based) are in a comma separated value file.
